[SYSTEM_LOG]: ORACLE PROTOCOL ENGINE
Status: v1.0.2-alpha

Uptime: Continuous

Objective: Processing global noise into predictive probability.

 *What is the Oracle Protocol?*
The Oracle Protocol is a decentralized intelligence layer designed to filter geopolitical, economic, and technological events through a predictive lens. We don't report the past; we calculate the most likely future.

 *The Engine*
Our system utilizes a multi-layered approach:

+ The Arcana Layer: Visual synthesis of market sentiment (The Cards).

+ The Probability Layer: Real-time data processing from prediction markets (Polymarket, Kalshi).

+ The Verdict: Final human-AI hybrid output.

 *Repository Contents*
/transmissions: Historical archive of issued prediction cards.

/logic: Documentation on probability weightings (Coming Soon).

/assets: Branding and visual guidelines for community nodes.

"The future is a calculation. The error is human."
